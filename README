So far, this script parses through all the subjects and exports the necessary information to a YAML file for easier parsing down the road, each file is named by subject. Code will be used later to display the information back to the user through a Ruby application.

Similar logic can be applied to any University which uses the Banner system for registration, hope it is helpful to all of you!

Dependencies: Mechanize - Form automation. Nokogiri - Parsing HTML. YAML - Output.
